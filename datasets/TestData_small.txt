ABSTRACT 
In Westerman’s [12] disruptive article, “Quantitative research as ? 
an interpretive enterprise: The mostly unacknowledged role of. 
interpretation in research efforts and suggestions for explicitly 
interpretive quantitative investigations,” he invited qualitative 
researchers in psychology to adopt quantitative methods into 
interpretive inquiry, given that they were as capable as qualitative 
measures in producing meaning-laden results. The objective of 
this article is to identify Westerman’s [12] key arguments and 
apply them to the practice of Learning Analytics in educational 
interventions. The primary implication for Learning Analytics 
practitioners is the need to interpret quantitative analysis 
procedures at every phase from philosophy to conclusions. 
Furthermore, Learning Analytics practitioners and consumers 
must critically examine any assumption that suggests quantitative 
methodologies in Learning Analytics are inherently objective or 
that Learning Analytics algorithms may replace judgment rather 
than aid it. Lastly we propose a method for making observational 
data in virtual environments concrete through nested models.   


In traditional cognitive science inquiry, measurement almost 
always involves significant levels of abstraction away from the 
phenomena of interest. Usually, observable behavior is of interest 
because it is assumed to indicate cognitive phenomena. For 
example, in learning measurement, the factors of interest are
