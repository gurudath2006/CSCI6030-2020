      " She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\n",
      "indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,\n",
      "been mistress of his house from a very early period. She dearly loved her father, but he\n",
      "was no companion for her. His spirits required support. \"My dear, how am I to get so far? \"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\n",
      "to be sure.\" That was\n",
      "your doing, papa. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time. \"Dirty, sir! said Emma playfully. \"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father. Oh dear, no! \"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! \"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very\n",
      "good young man, and I have a great regard for him. That will be a much better thing. From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\n",
      "curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\n",
      "returned that he had never been there in his life. I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,\n",
      "and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "comprehended many such. It was her own\n",
      "universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She was delighted\n",
      "to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with\n",
      "herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings\n",
      "of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\n",
      "was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated. She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\n",
      "conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\n",
      "inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\n",
      "shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\n",
      "grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly\n",
      "impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\n",
      "to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,\n",
      "and deserve encouragement. She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking\n",
      "and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that\n",
      "the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,\n",
      "which always closed such parties, and for which she had been\n",
      "used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,\n",
      "and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware. I do not advise the custard. Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the\n",
      "introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,\n",
      "grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,\n",
      "delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated\n",
      "her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last! It was quite a different sort of thing,\n",
      "a sentiment distinct and independent. Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never\n",
      "believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered\n",
      "the truth. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,\n",
      "a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared\n",
      "that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always\n",
      "mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something\n",
      "or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,\n",
      "no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\n",
      "friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she\n",
      "were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever. With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number\n",
      "and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\n",
      "and there was evidently no dislike to it. \"Well done, Mrs. thought Emma. \"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line\n",
      "of his own business? I thought him very plain\n",
      "at first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\n",
      "after a time. \"Only four-and-twenty. Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\" \"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. Yes. \"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is\n",
      "nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. \"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. \"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\" She, therefore, said no more for some time. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. If he means any thing,\n",
      "it must be to please you. Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving\n",
      "the young farmer out of Harriet's head. I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. She means it, I know.\" \"Yes,\" said he, smiling. Weston.\" \"Not I, indeed. say beautiful rather. \"I think her all you describe. With all dear Emma's little faults,\n",
      "she is an excellent creature. \"Very well; I will not plague you any more. It would not be a bad thing for her\n",
      "to be very much in love with a proper object. \"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. She was not less pleased another day with the manner\n",
      "in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture. dear, no, never.\" You know nothing of drawing. Pray, pray attempt it. yes, I observed it, I assure you. She played and sang;--and drew\n",
      "in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;\n",
      "and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\n",
      "would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\n",
      "or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,\n",
      "or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\n",
      "than it deserved. \"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma. Dear Mrs. Weston! She was so\n",
      "eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no\n",
      "making children of three or four years old stand still you know;\n",
      "nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the\n",
      "air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any\n",
      "of mama's children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth,\n",
      "who was a baby. That's very like. Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,\n",
      "and was repeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present\n",
      "indeed, as you observe. Exactly so. Mr. Elton was only too happy. \"By all means. replied he. We must allow for the effect\n",
      "of shade, you know.\" Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! Exactly so indeed!\" Just\n",
      "as your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws\n",
      "so well as you do. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,\n",
      "than it was removed. Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,\n",
      "and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it\n",
      "as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he\n",
      "seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough. said he with a tender sigh, as he\n",
      "received it. She was so surprized\n",
      "she did not know what to do. cried Harriet. \"Pray do. She read, and was surprized. Yes, I understand the sort\n",
      "of mind. \"Yes.\" \"Yes. Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\" \"Oh no, no! You will\n",
      "express yourself very properly, I am sure. My dear Harriet, what do you mean? I thought it my duty\n",
      "as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. Emma waited the result with impatience,\n",
      "but not without strong hopes. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. You would have thrown yourself out of all\n",
      "good society. yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\n",
      "happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business was finished, and Harriet safe. \"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly. It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight. Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger. I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. \"A very serious sort, I assure you;\" still smiling. Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint. Her visit to Abbey-Mill,\n",
      "this summer, seems to have done his business. \"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet\n",
      "means to marry him?\" He is\n",
      "an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. \"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it;\n",
      "but it may be inferred. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,\n",
      "and was refused.\" This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;\n",
      "and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,\n",
      "as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. Emma, this is\n",
      "your doing. By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples. exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;\n",
      "and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he\n",
      "is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense\n",
      "as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;\n",
      "Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly\n",
      "her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves\n",
      "is much above his.--It would be a degradation.\" She desired nothing better herself. You have been no friend to\n",
      "Harriet Smith, Emma. I know him well. Better be without sense,\n",

      "produces every sort of mischief. cried Mr. He was thinking. He continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will\n",
      "act rationally. \"Good morning to you,\"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little\n",

      "but could not repent. \"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. said she;\n",
      "\"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\n",
      "easier to you.\" The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma\n",

      "thinking of? For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith. their luxury and ease. That is _court_. Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown. She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. I thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived;\n",
      "but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,\n",
      "as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all\n",
      "my heart. Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\" \"Yes, very true. You understand every thing. \"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\" \"It is one thing,\" said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--\"to\n",
      "have very good sense in a common way, like every body else,\n",
      "and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,\n",
      "and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write\n",
      "verses and charades like this.\" Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?\" Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\n",
      "charade into my book! \"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer\n",
      "it lasts, the better I shall be pleased. Very true. `Woman, lovely woman.' Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\n",

      "is named after his father. And he is a very clever boy,\n",
      "indeed. \"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. \"Well, I cannot understand it.\" \"That is the case with us all, papa. Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. She pondered, but could think of nothing. \"Very true,\" said Harriet. dear, no,\" said her companion. They walked on. dear, yes,\" before the gentleman\n",
      "joined them. Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them. It must, if I were not here. This would not do;\n",
      "she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration\n",
      "to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete\n",
      "occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,\n",
      "and she would follow in half a minute. Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very\n",
      "pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning\n",
      "to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both\n",
      "looked around, and she was obliged to join them. Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\n",
      "and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\n",
      "was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's\n",
      "party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for\n",
      "the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,\n",
      "the beet-root, and all the dessert. Mr. Elton, I must beg\n",
      "leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit\n",
      "of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\" Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing\n",
      "could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into\n",
      "his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. She was then obliged to be finished,\n",
      "and make her appearance. Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished\n",
      "by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself\n",
      "that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,\n",
      "and must be leading them forward to the great event. She was not a woman\n",
      "of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance\n",
      "of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;\n",
      "was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,\n",
      "had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield\n",
      "in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea\n",
      "of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;\n",
      "and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.\" Weston.\" said John Knightley. \"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma. I thought it very well done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea\n",
      "you know, one cannot tell. Well,\n",
      "time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his\n",
      "parents and natural home! \"Yes,\" said he, smiling--\"and reason good. \"That's true,\" she cried--\"very true. Little Emma, grow up\n",
      "a better woman than your aunt. The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined\n",
      "cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his\n",
      "dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;\n",
      "on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;\n",
      "their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma\n",
      "only occasionally joining in one or the other. My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.\" good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\" \"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. \"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? \"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been\n",
      "of use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,\n",
      "I would have spoken to--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma,\n",
      "\"I have not heard one inquiry after them.\" \"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. my dear, it is not like Hartfield. \"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. cried Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley, hearing his own name. \"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" Here was a dangerous opening. said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on\n",
      "her with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed,\n",
      "\"Ah! A fine open sea, he says, and very\n",
      "pure air. You should have consulted Perry.\" \"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\n",
      "\"very true. . . . In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than\n",
      "their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out\n",
      "of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event\n",
      "that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been\n",
      "spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed\n",
      "with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed\n",
      "by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,\n",
      "as he exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\n",
      "which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\n",
      "care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of\n",
      "her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--\n",
      "but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions\n",
      "and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,\n",
      "was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its\n",
      "being \"very cold, certainly very cold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in\n",
      "having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power\n",
      "of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening. Weston.\" \"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\n",
      "is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook\n",
      "a great deal. \"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,\n",
      "\"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\" \"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\" I speak as a friend,\n",
      "Emma. They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,\n",
      "and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject. \"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal\n",
      "of it.\" \"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton. Nothing could be pleasanter. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more,\n",
      "to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted,\n",
      "and shew herself just as happy as she was. I should\n",
      "like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,\n",
      "and my son--and then I should say we were quite complete. If they are not put off, he cannot stir. Then turning to Isabella, who had not been\n",
      "attending before--\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley,\n",
      "that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill,\n",
      "in my opinion, as his father thinks. To be constantly living\n",
      "with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. There is jealousy. In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston\n",
      "were less sanguine.\" \"He ought to come,\" said Emma. Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,\n",
      "and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated\n",
      "sore throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say\n",
      "for some time. \"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she;\n",
      "\"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;\n",
      "and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. replied he. Walk home!--you are prettily shod\n",
      "for walking home, I dare say. \"I am ready, if the others are.\" \"Yes, do.\" And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. It would not have been\n",
      "the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\n",
      "previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked\n",
      "to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have\n",
      "seemed but one. But now, she would rather it had not happened. It really was so. But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,\n",
      "not at all to confuse his intellects. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond\n",
      "any thing I can express. cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?--\n",
      "Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course\n",
      "of my existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend:\n",
      "never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. Miss Woodhouse! No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,\n",
      "who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from\n",
      "Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--\n",
      "and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it\n",
      "seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:\n",
      "for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all\n",
      "kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort\n",
      "of her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin\n",
      "of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome;\n",
      "and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\n",
      "except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation;\n",
      "and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\n",
      "the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection. She had taken\n",
      "up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it. There I was quite right. That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left\n",
      "the rest to time and chance. I have been but half a friend to her;\n",
      "and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much, I am\n",
      "sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable\n",
      "for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe--\n",
      "a pert young lawyer.\" He was always agreeable\n",
      "and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note\n",
      "from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,\n",
      "to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, \"that he was proposing\n",
      "to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath;\n",
      "where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends,\n",
      "he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted\n",
      "the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of\n",
      "weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense--\n",
      "and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them.\" Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it\n",
      "was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self,\n",
      "she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance,\n",
      "and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment,\n",
      "as might naturally belong to their friendship. She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed\n",
      "quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps\n",
      "rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. \"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\n",
      "that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care\n",
      "very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with\n",
      "those who have always set him the example of it. \"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\n",
      "should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. \"Yes, sometimes he can.\" I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.' Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such\n",
      "a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up,\n",
      "and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room,\n",
      "I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine\n",
      "such conduct practicable?\" They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had\n",
      "done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know,\n",
      "as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he\n",
      "ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting\n",
      "their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better\n",
      "of him for submitting to their whims. My dear Emma,\n",
      "your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came\n",
      "to the point.\" `Have you, upon your honour?' said she;\n",
      "`well, that is quite unexpected. replied the happily deceived aunt,\n",
      "while eagerly hunting for the letter.--\"Oh! here it is. \"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\" Yes, next week. But they always do, you know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. \"Yes, so I imagined. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account\n",
      "of things.\" Campbell.\" \"Very true, very true, indeed. But you see, every thing turns out\n",
      "for the best. no. \"Yes, that of course.\" \"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! Such was Jane Fairfax's history. Still, however, affection was glad to catch\n",
      "at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment. It was her own choice to give the time of their\n",
      "absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect\n",
      "liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:\n",
      "and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,\n",
      "whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement\n",
      "their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few\n",
      "months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,\n",
      "than on any thing else. There, not to be vulgar,\n",
      "was distinction, and merit. In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax\n",
      "with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense\n",
      "of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike\n",
      "her no longer. Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\n",
      "as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\n",
      "afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;\n",
      "nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her. Former provocations reappeared. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved. It was all general approbation and smoothness;\n",
      "nothing delineated or distinguished. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned\n",
      "to her first surmises. I do not know a more\n",
      "luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained\n",
      "a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music\n",
      "and sometimes with conversation. You left nothing undone. \"I am disappointed,\" was his only answer. \"I had. \"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.\" I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.\" \"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. \"That's right, my dear, very right. yes, I always like news. Mr. Elton is going\n",
      "to be married.\" cried Miss Bates. \"Where could\n",
      "you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? But, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "how could you possibly have heard it? My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. By his style, I should imagine it just settled.\" \"Mr. Elton going to be married!\" said Emma, as soon as she could speak. \"He is very young to settle,\" was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have never seen\n",
      "Mr. cried Emma. \"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming\n",
      "young man, quite worthy of him. What is before me, I see. those dear little children. Jane, do you know I always fancy\n",
      "Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. \"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\n",
      "and that you yourself--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,\n",
      "I always think a person well-looking. Thank you, we do indeed. Good morning to you,\n",
      "my dear sir. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning\n",
      "to you.\" Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!\" which instantly\n",
      "burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. only think. I thought I should have fainted. Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done\n",
      "any thing than have it happen:  and yet, you know, there was a sort\n",
      "of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make\n",
      "me comfortable again.\" She was not thoroughly\n",
      "comfortable herself. Ambition, as well as love,\n",
      "had probably been mortified. Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare\n",
      "twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction. Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. On that article, truth seemed attainable. She brought no name, no blood, no alliance. She had talked her into love; but, alas! And now, poor girl! But Mr. Elton,\n",
      "in person, had driven away all such cares. She went on herself, to give that portion\n",
      "of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell. It was a bad business. Presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt\n",
      "by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her. --\n",
      "was a question, however, which did not augur much. \"My dear, dear anxious friend,\"--said she, in mental soliloquy,\n",
      "while walking downstairs from her own room, \"always overcareful\n",
      "for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your\n",
      "little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure\n",
      "that all is right.\" One cannot creep upon a journey;\n",
      "one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the\n",
      "pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins,\n",
      "is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.\" Weston.\" Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected\n",
      "from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession\n",
      "of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were\n",
      "to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. Call upon her, by all means.\" go to-day, go to-day. said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;\n",
      "\"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very\n",
      "agreeable young lady. Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\n",
      "and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \"My good friend,\n",
      "this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he\n",
      "sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown\n",
      "in a hop, step, and jump.\" They walked thither directly. But on seeing them together,\n",
      "she became perfectly satisfied. No, it was long enough, broad enough,\n",
      "handsome enough. \"Yes, oh! But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? yes, gloves and every thing. You will be adored in Highbury. I like them all.\" Frank Churchill hardly knows\n",
      "what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. \"I certainly do forget to think of _her_,\" said Emma, \"as having ever\n",
      "been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\" repeated Emma. said Emma, highly amused.--\"Mr. Dixon is very musical,\n",
      "is he? \"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal\n",
      "stronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all\n",
      "agreeable to me. \"It was her very particular friend, you know.\" said Emma, laughing. \"You are right. \"Oftentimes\n",
      "very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety\n",
      "in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.\" In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\n",
      "of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances\n",
      "were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--\n",
      "one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit\n",
      "among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows\n",
      "or smiles--Mr. Knightley. just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.\" This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years\n",
      "in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,\n",
      "and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,\n",
      "in trade, and only moderately genteel. Upon the whole, she was very persuadable;\n",
      "and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be\n",
      "done without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard,\n",
      "if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company--\n",

      "and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\n",
      "to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\n",
      "people in schemes on the subject. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks\n",
      "seriously about it. no,\" said he; \"it would be the extreme of imprudence. \"We were too magnificent,\" said he. Emma demurred. \"Very true,\" he gravely replied; \"it was very bad.\" Nothing can be farther from pleasure\n",
      "than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\" \"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination\n",
      "for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the\n",
      "terrors of my father's little rooms. It is his own idea. If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls. They would catch\n",
      "worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.\" \"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. \"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. I doubt it. I do not know her,\n",

      "engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young\n",
      "people set off together without delay for the Crown. \"My dear, you are too particular,\" said her husband. One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. This made a difficulty. We shall not be many,\n",
      "you know.\" And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\n",
      "through the passage, was calling out,\n",
      "\n",

But this was not judged feasible. Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. As to his going, it was inevitable. His dejection\n",
      "was most evident. \"But you will come again,\" said Emma. Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "why are you always so right?\" \"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. Emma looked graciously. Happy those, who can remain\n",
      "at Highbury!\" You would not have been\n",
      "so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.\" \"Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. \"I certainly must,\" said she. Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings. This, Emma could not doubt, was all\n",
      "for herself. It was all my doing, I know. Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\" Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,\n",
      "longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing. Emma thought at least it would turn out so. \"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted\n",
      "the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;\n",
      "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--\n",
      "Is not she very charming?\" \"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\" \"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\" \"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\" \"Yes,\" said Harriet earnestly, \"and well she might, nobody could ever\n",
      "have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. A charming place,\n",
      "undoubtedly. yes, I am quite aware of that. They would hardly come in their chaise,\n",
      "I think, at that season of the year. I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--\n",

You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. I like them extremely. She was your governess, I think?\" \"Mrs. Weston's manners,\" said Emma, \"were always particularly good. Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.\" Happily, it was now time to be gone. was her immediate exclamation. And Mrs. Worse and worse. Frank Churchill comes as regularly into\n",
      "my mind!\" Mr. Elton knows you.\" \"My dear, you do not understand me. Emma had done. Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. We must bring her forward. \"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\n",
      "this invitation,\" was Emma's conclusion. \"She must be under some\n",
      "sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. \"You are right, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"Miss Fairfax\n",
      "is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton. We feel things differently. \"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\" said Emma. What I said\n",
      "just now, meant nothing. You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,\n",
      "if you were married.\" \"Yes, very soon. She calls you, Knightley--what can\n",
      "she do for Mr. Cole? \"I see how it is,\" said she. If this is living in the country,\n",
      "it is nothing very formidable. The persons to be invited, required little thought. She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy\n",
      "wife together, without feeling uncomfortable. She was delighted with the fortitude\n",
      "of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give\n",
      "up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\n",

      "Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had\n",
      "often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. Every invitation was successful. It saves trouble, and is a something\n",
      "to get me out. \"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\" It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. \"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office\n",
      "in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,\n",
      "how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there\n",
      "to take care of you.\" Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable. she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\" eagerly rejoined\n",
      "Mrs. Elton. That will obviate\n",
      "all difficulties you know; and from _us_ I really think, my dear Jane,\n",
      "you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.\" \"My dear Jane, say no more about it. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write\n",
      "very much alike. \"Yes,\" said his brother hesitatingly, \"there is a likeness. \"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,\" said Mr. Woodhouse;\n",
      "\"and always did. No, she had\n",

      "or to Clifton?\" A fine place, but very retired.\" \"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\n",
      "the road than Maple Grove. This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear madam! Elton.\" \"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. \"You were mentioning May. She was the instigator. She was nobody\n",

      "a great difference in your way of life.\" Witness this very time. Your neighbourhood\n",
      "is increasing, and you mix more with it. \"Yes,\" said his brother quickly, \"it is Randalls that does it all.\" \"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\n",

There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her. She watched him well. This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. He was quite delighted. Now, it would\n",

      "He seemed often observing her. That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,\n",
      "was indubitable. Escape, however, was not his plan. She was not yet dancing; she was working her way\n",

      "like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular\n",
      "compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high\n",
      "expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,\n",
      "promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof\n",

Adopt her, educate her.\" \"By all means, if you can.\" \"Very well. \"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else. Remember.\" \"If you please, my dear. I am quite ready. There she is--no, that's somebody else. While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off. cried Emma, \"I know there is not a better creature in the world:\n",
      "but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are\n",
      "most unfortunately blended in her.\" It was badly done, indeed! He had turned away, and the horses were\n",
      "in motion. She was most forcibly struck. As she reflected more, she seemed\n",
      "but to feel it more. A whole evening of back-gammon with\n",
      "her father, was felicity to it. As a daughter,\n",
      "she hoped she was not without a heart. Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she\n",
      "saw him not. Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--\n",
      "and are come to give us joy. One cannot wonder,\n",
      "one cannot wonder. But then Patty came in, and said it was you. Emma was most sincerely interested. replied Miss Bates. The most indefatigable, true friend. \"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. Within a fortnight. Mr. Elton was called\n",
      "out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak\n",
      "with him. That was what happened before tea. Elton.\" \"Nothing at all. \"Poor Mrs. Churchill! --\n",
      "Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,\n",
      "\"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!\" Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance. She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew\n",
      "a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration. The invitation was refused, and by\n",
      "a verbal message. She was sorry,\n",
      "very sorry. \"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. \"Certainly. This moment, if you please. But hush, hush!\" To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened\n",
      "in Brunswick Square. Emma's courage returned, and she walked on. Her fancy was very active. said she, as they proceeded--\n",
      "speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with\n",
      "any other view. yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\" I have been walking all this way in complete suspense. \"You are right. Emma thought first of herself, and then\n",
      "of Harriet. Fortunately, however, it did cease. \"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said\n",
      "so expressly. cried Emma, not attending to her.--\"Mrs. Smallridge, too! \"He knew nothing about it, Emma. \"I am to hear from him soon,\" continued Mrs. Weston. Let us wait, therefore, for this letter. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\" thought Emma, \"he would have done as much for Harriet.\" \"None; not one. \"True. \"Much, indeed!\" cried Emma feelingly. I thought you had lost half your property, at least. Frank Churchill had behaved\n",
      "very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much\n",
      "_his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was her\n",
      "superior duty. \"Well, Miss Woodhouse!\" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\n",
      "\"is not this the oddest news that ever was?\" --said Emma, still perplexed. Emma looked\n",
      "at her, quite unable to speak. cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. \"Him!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\" turning away distressed. cried Emma, after a moment's pause--\"What do you mean?--\n",
      "Good Heaven! Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us\n",
      "understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you speaking of--Mr. When we talked about him, it was as clear\n",
      "as possible.\" Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\" cried Emma, \"this has been a most unfortunate--\n",
      "most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\" But you are too good for that,\n",
      "I am sure.\" \"Mr. Martin! To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the\n",
      "first endeavour. This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,\n",
      "which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--\n",
      "She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation\n",
      "but the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley's.--\n",
      "Alas! _She_ could not. This was one of her expressions. said Emma. I have been acting\n",
      "contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\n",
      "thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\n",
      "conscience tells me ought not to be.' said Emma again. \"She loves him then excessively,\n",
      "I suppose. \"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. \"Are you well, my Emma?\" was Mrs. Weston's parting question. perfectly. I am always well, you know. The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. They would be married, and settled either\n",
      "at or near Enscombe. They walked together. He was silent. cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks\n",
      "towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he\n",
      "might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way. She wished him to speak, but he\n",
      "would not. She went on, however. returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. \"And I do envy him, Emma. said he. --repeated Mr. Say `No,' if it is to be said.\" The manner, perhaps, may have as little\n",
      "to recommend them. Frank Churchill's\n",
      "character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\n",
      "when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought\n",
      "of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort\n",
      "of fellow. With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered. Weston.] WINDSOR-JULY. This was the fact. I behaved shamefully. She absolutely refused to allow me,\n",
      "which I then thought most unreasonable. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you. \"You had better go on,\" said she. After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully\n",
      "was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing. \"I perfectly agree with you, sir,\"--was then his remark. She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without\n",
      "the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,\n",
      "instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance\n",
      "of Box Hill seemed to exist. `Dearer, much dearer than ever.' Come, he knows himself there. That was your name for him, was it?\" \"Yes, certainly it does. And now, let me talk to you of something else. Part only of this answer,\n",
      "however, was admitted. there is one difficulty unprovided for,\" cried Emma. And, in fact, you have heard all the\n",
      "essential already. You would have doated\n",
      "on her, had you gone.--But not a word more. Very pleasant party. yes, quite indispensable.\" said Emma. Knightley\n",
      "was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\" \"Your parish there was small,\" said Jane. you clever creature, that's very true. Mr. Elton made his appearance. Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. And no apology left, no message\n",
      "for me. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. \"Very.\" as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. Campbell.\" cried Emma; \"at that rate, what will become of her?\" I am losing\n",
      "all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. \"`Mr. \"John does not even mention your friend,\" said Mr. Knightley. \"My Emma, he means no such thing. That was all very true. It was all right,\n",
      "all open, all equal. In general, it was a very well approved match. It would never do. said she, quickly, looking up in his face. cried he. \"You have, I believe, and know the whole.\" \"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\" \"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,\n",
      "but I cannot believe it. You only mean,\n",
      "that he intends it.\" she cried.--\"Well!\" How, where, when?--Let me know it all. She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. cried Mr. Knightley. cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah! She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. They arrived.--Mrs. \"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston. said he, turning his eyes towards Jane. Early, I know,\n",
      "you had none.\" \"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\" \"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma. He bowed. \"True, true,\" he answered, warmly. \"No, not true on your side. Look at her. Frank Churchill caught the name. \"My friend Mr. Perry! he cried. Look at her. Still, however, he was not happy.\n"
