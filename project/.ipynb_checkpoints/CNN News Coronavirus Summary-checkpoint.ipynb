      "In recent weeks, the Asian city-state has had a dramatic spike in coronavirus infections, with thousands of new cases linked to clusters in foreign worker dormitories. To control the spread, the government has attempted to isolate the dormitories, test workers and move symptomatic patients into quarantine facilities. But those measures have left hundreds of thousands of workers trapped in their dormitories, living cheek by jowl in cramped conditions that make social distancing near impossible.Singapore is home to about 1.4 million migrant workers who come largely from South and Southeast Asia. As housekeepers, domestic helpers, construction workers and manual laborers, these migrants are essential to keeping Singapore functioning -- but are also some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable people in the city.Rubel, who goes only by one name, came to Singapore from Bangladesh six years ago to work in construction and earn money for his family. Now, with his health and safety at risk, he's worried for those who depend on him.\"I'm scared of this coronavirus, because if I catch it I cannot take care of my family,\" he said.In the first three months of the coronavirus pandemic, Singapore was praised for its response and apparent ability to suppress infections without resorting to extreme measures.Then, in April, the number of cases exploded. Since March 17, Singapore's total cases grew from 266 to 12,075, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Even as the number of new cases surged past 1,000 a day, only a dozen or so per day were Singapore citizens of permanent residents; the rest were all migrant workers. Singapore was built by migrants Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, is often credited as the visionary who helped transform the city-state into the developed metropolis it is today. But much of Singapore, including iconic sites like the gleaming Marina Bay Sands, was built by imported labor.Forty years ago, Singapore was less economically developed, with a per-capita income of $4,071 a year, according to the International Labor Organization. Without much land or natural resources, the government instead focused on investing in education, especially in the STEM subjects and vocational training, and creating an export-oriented economy that would obtain wealth through industrialization.But Singapore had -- and still has -- a small population, presenting the problem of manpower. So the government turned to foreign labor, and has been doing so ever since. Of the city's 5.7 million residents today, nearly a quarter are foreign workers, according to government figures.The ambitious plan to develop Singapore worked -- at least, for Singaporeans. The cheap foreign labor fueled growth, raising Singapore's average income to $56,786 by 2019 and making it one of the wealthiest places in the world in GDP per capita.But critics say that foreign workers have been sidelined, left mostly living in tougher conditions with fewer benefits or protections than their Singaporean neighbors -- meaning when a crisis like Covid-19 arrives, they are the first and hardest hit.The dormitories were a 'time bomb'Singapore started seeing its cases spike around April 4, with 75 new cases -- its biggest single-day jump at the time. Authorities traced clusters back to the dormitories, which were built specifically for migrant workers and subject to government regulations. About 200,000 workers live in 43 dormitories in Singapore, according to Minister of Manpower Josephine Teo.Conditions are usually cramped, with about 10 to 20 workers sharing each room. Government regulations require the rooms provide 4.5 square meters (about 48 square feet) per occupant, meaning the rooms typically range from 45 to 90 square meters (484 to 968 square feet).Videos sent to CNN from one dormitory show workers lying in a line of bunk beds, where they sleep just a few feet away from each other. The workers, the majority of whom are male, and from less economically developed countries, share toilets, shower stalls, laundry clotheslines, storage spaces, and line up together to receive food.There's simply no way to self-isolate or avoid close contact, which may be why the coronavirus spread so fast and far here.There's also the fact that authorities seem to have overlooked this risk and didn't alert the migrant worker community until it was too late, said Alex Au, vice president of the Singaporean non-profit organization Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2).\"When the government of Singapore, governments all over the world, issued safe distancing advice, I think they overlooked the fact that safe distancing cannot be possible when construction workers and other blue-collar workers are housed ten men, 20 men, in a room,\" he said. \"The failure, I think, to see clearly the risks and to take measures to mitigate the risks, left us with a very bad situation right now.\"As the number of new daily cases spiked, the government locked down dorms, stepped up hygiene measures inside, and closed recreational common spaces, said the Ministry of Manpower. They also tried to space out residents more, and moved some workers into military camps, floating hotels, and vacant government apartments.In some dorms, workers say the government measures have reassured residents. Zasim, a 27-year-old worker from Bangladesh, said he had been provided with face masks, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies, soap, and fresh fruit by the government. Authorities had also supplied free WiFi and extra phone cards so Zasim and his dorm-mates could spend their days under lockdown talking to friends and family, he said.Like Rubel, Zasim's main concern was the shutdown's financial impact -- but he feels less worried now that the government has said migrant workers should get paid, even if they can't work, and subsidized employers to make that possible.Rubel, too, said his living spaces are now clean and the workers are provided with food -- but the mood at his dorm  remains tense. Even with the additional protective measures, people are still sharing close quarters, and workers worry they may be living among asymptomatic carriers.\"It's extremely stressful for anybody to be confined in these conditions,\" said Desiree Leong, the casework executive at the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics in Singapore. \"You're being kept in there all day, or most of the day. It's causing a lot of anxiety and stress, a lot of tension.\"Tommy Koh, a Singapore lawyer and former diplomat, was more blunt in a widely-shared Facebook post earlier this month.\"The dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode,\" he wrote. \"The way Singapore treats its foreign workers is not First World but Third World. The government has allowed their employers to transport them in flat bed trucks with no seats. They stay in overcrowded dormitories and are packed likes sardines with 12 persons to a room.\"Calls for reformThe crisis unfolding in the dormitories has led activists to call for broader reforms on living and working conditions for migrant workers beyond the coronavirus pandemic.Working in a city without a minimum wage, they earn a fraction of the salaries of white-collar employees. The average migrant worker earns about $400 to $465 a month, compared to the average Singaporean monthly salary of $3,077, according to data from TWC2.Some employers also don't provide medical care or paid sick leave to migrant workers -- the consequences of which became clear during the pandemic. Even as late as March, some employers discouraged their migrant workers from going to the doctor when they felt unwell, or docked their pay for taking the time off, said Leong.And workers don't have many avenues to address these issues; their visas are tied to their employers, who can terminate work permits at any time, so filing a complaint against your boss could jeopardize not only your job but your migration status.\"This present crisis actually reflects a far bigger systemic problem of the state being relatively fine or not so concerned about the welfare, the well-being, and the rights of migrants,\" said Au, the NGO vice president.Singapore's Ministry of Manpower has previously said that it prosecutes employers who willfully refuse to pay workers, and has taken action against dormitory operators who fail to follow regulations. An operating company and its director were prosecuted last year after their dormitories were found to have broken lights and shower taps, and \"filthy\" living conditions.In light of the coronavirus outbreak, however, some government leaders are acknowledging there is still much work to be done in improving migrant workers' rights and standards of living.\"Should standards in foreign worker dormitories be raised? There's no question in my mind, answer is 'yes',\" wrote Minister Teo on Facebook in early April, as the first few dormitories were being locked down.\"I hope the Covid-19 episode demonstrates to the employers and wider public that raising standards at worker dormitories is not only the right thing to do, but also in our own interests,\" she wrote. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also thanked migrant workers for their contributions to Singapore and their cooperation during the pandemic in a press release on Tuesday.\"To our migrant workers, let me emphasize again: we will care for you, just like we care for Singaporeans,\" he said. \"We will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood. We will work with your employers to make sure that you get paid, and you can send money home ... This is our duty and responsibility to you, and your families.\"\n",

      "In fact, it's those very questions that he is helping us answer.  Sean is helping all of us figure out if it is safe, by putting up his hand first and volunteering. With that injection, Sean had become a critical part of the fastest moving vaccine trials in the history of the world, a vaccine for Covid-19.During a pandemic, the urgency is understandable. In just a few months, the virus has spread to nearly every corner of the globe and sadly taken more lives than several wars or natural disasters combined. It is also true that no one on the planet is immune to this; such is the nature of a novel or new coronavirus. As you process all that, remember that last Thanksgiving, this wasn't even a real concern for human beings, and not even a topic of idle conversation. And, now it is the only thing being discussed in hospitals, boardrooms and at kitchen tables every night, often by Zoom. So, yes. The urgent pace is quite understandable but we have to make sure we can sprint, while also not tripping, falling and getting hurt.  When I sat outside with Sean recently at Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, where he is studying and I am on the neurosurgery faculty, it may have appeared to be just another meeting between student and teacher. If you looked a little closer, however, you would've noticed that we were sitting several feet apart, masks tucked around our necks, raising our voices a bit to make sure we could be heard. I really wanted to understand how Sean had decided to volunteer for an experimental vaccine. I wanted to understand how he processed and assessed risk. As a dad, I wanted to know what his parents thought.It was no surprise to me that, despite the fact he hadn't been born yet, Sean was familiar with the story of the swine flu vaccine of 1976. In January of that year, a new or novel virus began spreading at Fort Dix in New Jersey. Fearful that this new virus might cause a pandemic like the one in 1918, the United States rushed a vaccine through development. Within a year, nearly 25% of Americans had been vaccinated, around 45 million people. Without enough time to perform adequate safety trials, however, devastating side effects started to emerge. Hundreds of people developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralysis that starts in the feet and slowly marches up your body. Several people also died, and for some, a fear of vaccination remains to this day. \"That was definitely a concern,\" Sean told me, \"potentially developing things like Guillain-Barre. It is a risk.\"With this particular vaccine, no one knows what the chances of that are. But those potential risks are outweighed, I think, by the potential benefits of this vaccine, because right now there are no great preventative measures for containing this virus.\"               A bold timetable for a challenging diseaseDr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar focused on emerging infectious disease at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, notes the timeline for this vaccine is quick compared to others. U.S. health officials have said a vaccine could be ready in 12 to 18 months -- lighting speed in the world of vaccine development.\"Vaccine development is usually measured in years and sometimes even decades,\" Adalja said. \"And there are some infectious diseases for which we have no vaccine after decades and decades of work, like HIV or hepatitis C, for example.\"\"The only way that we're going to really contain this virus is with the vaccine,\" Adalja said.Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading expert on infectious disease and vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, believes the 12-to-18-month timeline may be wishful thinking.\"I can't think of another example where things have gone that quickly,\" Hotez said. The quickest vaccine ever developed was against mumps. After vaccine inventor Maurice Hilleman isolated the mumps virus from his 5-year-old daughter in 1963, it sped to market in four years. Doing that in a fraction of the time would be a challenge, Hotez believes.\"We're certainly trying, I mean, our scientists are working day and night in the lab now,\" he said.When side effects mean giant setbacksSafety is always paramount, but especially with vaccines. Unlike therapeutics, which are often first trialed in people with the late stage of a disease, vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent the disease. The risk of causing illness or even death in an otherwise healthy person haunts everyone involved in the coronavirus response.Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies programme, said in a briefing last month that time is needed to test the new vaccines.\"Many people are asking, 'Well why do we have to test the vaccines? Why don't we just make the vaccines and give them to people?' Well the world has learned many lessons in the mass use of vaccines and there's only one thing more dangerous than a bad virus, and that's a bad vaccine,\" Ryan said. \"We have to be very, very, very careful in developing any product that we're going to inject into potentially most of the world population. We have to be very, very, very careful that we first do no harm. So that's why people are being careful.\" The 1976 swine flu vaccine debacle is one of the best-known instances, but there have been more recent failures. In 2017, a campaign to vaccinate nearly 1 million children for mosquito-borne dengue virus in the Philippines had to be stopped because the vaccine actually raised the risk of severe dengue infection in some people. Ten children died.In the rush to protect kids against an infection that makes 400 million people sick and kills 22,000 every year globally, officials ignored warnings that the vaccine should only be used in people who have already been infected once. Dengue is actually caused by four different viruses and the first infection is usually mild, while the later infections are more dangerous. In this situation, vaccinating people who had never been infected sometimes raised their risk of complications if they were then infected with a different strain.The earliest vaccines, such as the smallpox vaccine used for hundreds of years, involved inoculating people with a real, live, virus in the hope that a controlled dose and infection would provide immunity. It was a gamble, and many people became very ill or died from such attempts.Later vaccines used related but less harmful viruses. In the 20th century, scientists learned how to kill or weaken viruses and bacteria in the lab and use those to vaccinate.Hotez believes safety controls are better now, but the timeline still presents a challenge.\"The question is, will a year to 18 months be adequate time to monitor for safety?\" he asked.Can we hijack genetic material to get a vaccine faster?Typically, vaccines are first tested in the lab and then in animals before they get to the three-stage clinical trials stage. Phase I clinical trials look at whether the vaccine is safe in a few people. The second phase involves more people, who are often given varying doses to test whether the vaccine causes the desired immune response and which dose might work best. The third and final phase gathers data on whether the vaccine really protects people, usually in real-life conditions.Because coronavirus is such an overwhelming threat, this careful and ponderous timeline is being compacted enormously. Vaccines started human testing just months into the pandemic, and some tests are being run simultaneously on humans and animals. Remember, vaccines work on a simple principle: priming the body's immune system to recognize, attack and neutralize a bacterial or viral infection.Vaccine makers got a head start on a Covid-19 vaccine because work had already started on vaccines against two related coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, which infected about 8,000 people and killed close to 800 before it was stopped in 2004, and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus or MERS, which causes occasional outbreaks.So scientists already knew a great deal about the mechanism by which this particular virus used its spike protein to enter human cells and how to inhibit that process.One new approach relies on using genetic material that looks like bits of a microbe and that stimulates the body to produce an immune response. There's no chance of accidental infection, because no virus is actually used. For coronavirus, one hope is that using messenger RNA -- the genetic material that directs cells to produce something -- will offer the quickest and safest path.In this case, the RNA vaccine would stimulate cells to make those spike proteins that look like pieces of coronavirus. If it works properly, upon being exposed to those engineered fragments of the virus, the body would be taught to recognize them, and be prepared to defend against them if there was a future attack or infection. RNA vaccines are quick and relatively easy to make, which is why they are already being tested in people. All a lab needs is the genetic sequence of the virus. But no such vaccine has ever been approved for use in the population. Another, more time-tested approach to fighting coronavirus employs viral vector vaccines. These use viruses harmless to people, genetically engineered to carry bits of the target virus -- in this case, the Covid-19 virus. The harmless virus causes a symptom-free infection, and the immune system learns to recognize the harmful genes.But while the technology means quick progress, Adalja said they are also still new.They can fail, or produce unexpected side effects.When it comes to RNA vaccines, \"there is no precedent yet for them being approved for use and, and we don't know everything about them in terms of how they're going to behave in large numbers of people and what the side effect profile they might be,\" Adalja said.It's something that Sean Doyle has considered not only now, but once before as well. Back in 2017, he raised his hand to be among the first to be injected with the Ebola vaccine. He was a first-year medical student at the time, and watched as the first patient in the United States was treated at his medical school, Emory. Sean remembers exactly what led him to participate.\"I remember the fear that was surrounding both the outbreak in West Africa,\" he said. \"The fear for the folks there and their health, but also fear about whether or not the virus could get out from West Africa and spread to other places around the world.\"And while the outbreak was contained before the vaccine trial began, he knew taking part of the trial meant if it ever happened again, there could be a vaccine that would hopefully be deployed quickly.Then, like now, Sean knows it's volunteers like him who put themselves at risk for the greater good -- whatever that entails.\"There were conversations that I had with friends and family,\" he said. \"They all expressed concerns about getting an experimental vaccine like this where no one knows what the side effects might be. But they trusted my judgment.\"\n",
